# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This project performs customer segmentation using **K-Means clustering** and **PCA** for visualization. It processes customer data (or generates a sample dataset if none exists), handles preprocessing and encoding, scales features, clusters customers into 5 groups, and visualizes the clusters in 2D.

> ðŸ§  Helps businesses understand customer groups to improve marketing and sales strategies.

- Applies K-Means clustering with 5 clusters
- Visualizes clusters using PCA in a 2D scatter plot
- Saves clustered data with assigned cluster labels to CSV
